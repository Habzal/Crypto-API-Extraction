# Crypto-API-Extraction
Implemented an automated workflow to extract cryptocurrency data from the CoinMarketCap API. This process involves retrieving JSON data and transforming it into a structured format using a Pandas DataFrame. Once we have the data organized, we save it to a CSV file for further analysis.

After storing the data, we conduct a thorough cleaning process to ensure its quality and usability. Finally, we visualize the cleaned data using Seaborn and Matplotlib, creating informative charts and graphs to better understand trends and insights in the cryptocurrency market.
